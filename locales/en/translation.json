        "what-is-it-for": "Perhaps one of the most surprising facts for parents is that child car seats have an expiration date, known as the 'expiry period.' This expiry period exists because the materials used in child car seats can age, causing their behavior to change over time. A perfect example of this is plastic, which tends to become stiffer with age and may not absorb forces from a collision as it should. It's essential for everyone to consider this when purchasing a used car seat. While buying a high-quality car seat is a clear choice for safety, it's even more costly to compromise on safety when it comes to our children's well-being during car journeys.  Another fact that if a family is expecting their third child, it's highly likely that the first child car seat they purchased will no longer be suitable, as its expiry period has likely passed. The simplest way to address this issue is to set a reminder in our calendars a few years after purchasing the seat, reminding us when its expiry period is due. If you are into to buy a used car seat, it's crucial to remove the cover, check the purchase year, and find the manufacturing year on the seat for any visible signs of damage. Nevertheless, when purchasing a used seat, one can never be entirely sure whether the car in which it was previously used was involved in even a minor accident, which could affect the seat's future performance in a potential real-life collision.",

          "The ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club) is a German automobile club, a highly esteemed organization. This club conducts various tests, including those on child car seats, aiming to help parents navigate through the tremendous amount of options available. Safety, ergonomics, materials used in manufacturing, and ease of cleaning are among the key criteria evaluated in these tests. By averaging the scores of these characteristics, a rating between 1.5 and 5.5 is obtained.",
          "The VTI and NTF (National Society for Road Safety) introduced the Plus Test in Sweden in 2009. The Plus Test sets particularly strict test requirements and is an additional test that is voluntary for car child seat manufacturers. Since an update to the test protocol in 2023, no forward-facing car child seats can undergo the test. The fundamental idea behind the Plus Test is that no child in a car child seat recommended by the Plus Test should ever suffer a dangerous, or even life-threatening, injury due to a collision. \n\n The Swedish Plus Test is so rigorous that only rear-facing car seats can meet its standards. Prior to 2011, tests did not assess harmful substances, whereas from 2015 onwards, usability and ergonomics were the sole focus.",
          "ECE R44 04 is the older European approval standard that is being phased out. Child seats with this certification can still be used, but new child seats will only be approved under the new standard (R-129), as ECE R44/04 will be phased out from September 2024. \n\n It's not tested for side impact and based on the child's weight.",
          "The new European Union standard gradually replacing the ECE R44 standard. The i-Size standard has stricter safety requirements, including side-impact testing and mandatory use of ISOFIX. \n\n In June 2013, the i-Size ECE R129 standard came into effect, elevating child car seat safety to a new level. \n The new regulation imposes mandatory safety requirements for child car seats, providing enhanced protection in the event of an accident. Certain safety expectations, now considered essential, were not compulsory under the ECE R44/04 standard, which has been in place since 2005. Manufacturers could choose whether to incorporate these advanced protections or settle for standard quality. \n\n The need for the new standard arose due to the shortcomings of the old standard and the advancements in car manufacturing, child car seat design, and safety technology that made it both possible and necessary. \n\n Why was the new i-Size standard created then? in short: avoid human error (= parent error) \n\n -Too many children died in car accidents. The leading cause of child fatalities is car accidents. Although the number of child deaths has decreased, in Europe, 10 children still died on the roads every week, and approximately 1150 are injured. (Sources: WHO (2007), EEVC Working Group 18 Report (February 2006). Survey in 12 European countries among children aged 0–14 (2003)). Since than it has improved a lot. Children have the lowest mortality rate compared to other age-groups, and the mortality rate has also decreased the most out of all age groups over the last decade. \n The absolute number of road fatalities among children between 2011 and 2020 decreased by 47%, from 733 fatalities in 2011 to 386 fatalities in 2020. As the total number of road fatalities was decreasing less rapidly, their relative share decreased slightly. Within the group of children, the largest decrease in fatalities could be observed among the age-group of 5–9 year olds.  \n In terms of transport mode, children had a very high death toll among the most vulnerable modes of transport: 32% of children killed were pedestrians, 13% were cyclists. These figures are EU averages but there are much higher percentages in a number of EU countries.  \n In Romania and Greece, more than one in two fatalities among children was a pedestrian. In the Netherlands, 47% of fatalities among children were cyclists.The differences between the percentages for children and all fatalities reflect the mobility behaviour of children. link: https://road-safety.transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/7f00b402-9aa2-44c7-b3c0-aaa6f81e0abd_en?filename=ff_children_20220706.pdf \n\n - ISOFIX is needed since many child car seats are improperly installed. Properly securing a child car seat with the car's seatbelt can be too lengthy and complicated for many parents, leading to 27% of parents installing the seat incorrectly. To address this, the best solution is ISOFIX. The rate of incorrect installation drops to just 4% with ISOFIX seats. The new i-Size ECE R129 standard requires child seats to be ISOFIX-compatible, as the standard mandates ISOFIX. However using ISOFIX does not mean it's safer then using belt properly. \n Many older cars on the road lack ISOFIX. While ISOFIX has become more common in cars manufactured after 2006–2007, it was often an optional feature. However, in cars produced from January 2011 onwards, ISOFIX is standard equipment. \n\n - Another huge issue is that parents switch to larger car seats too soon. \n\n - High incidence of side impacts. 25% of car accidents involve side impacts. Independent crash tests long focused only on frontal impacts, as none of the ECE R44 standards (from ECE R44/01–02–03 to the ECE R44/04 in effect since 2005) required side impact protection systems or testing protocols. The new ECE R129 i-Size standard introduced the necessity for side impact tests. i-Size car seats now require side protection systems, particularly for the head, neck, and hips, making such tests possible.",

In Hungary, after the first year, there is a 2-year distributor's warranty where you have to prove that the manufacturer is at fault if something breaks. \n\nIn the case of Gazelle, it is crucial that the serial number of the secondary seat is found on the original box packaging, not on the seat and frame bottom. If you do not keep or photograph it, you will not be able to claim the warranty in case of a problem with the secondary seat without a serial number. In our case, our Gazelle's frame with the primary seat is from Mamas&Papas, where they smoothly helped with the issue of the canopy sliding. I personally bought the secondary seat from the Mamilla store, where they did not draw my attention to the serial number on the box, so we left without it. Warranty handling is currently quite cumbersome with them.",

        "intro": "When it comes to choosing baby gear, parents often seek products that combine safety, convenience, and style. The Doona Infant Car Seat Stroller has gained significant popularity for its unique features and innovative design. But is it the right choice for you? \n\n Doona X represents the new generation of the Doona Car Seat & Stroller, offering three recline positions: Sit, Relax, and Lay Back. This feature allows your child to lie down and relax comfortably. Like the Doona i, it meets the European i-Size safety regulation (R-129) and includes an adjustable harness and headrest. The Doona X also boasts patented shock absorbers and a smooth-release system for a smoother, safer ride, along with the Doona SIP add-on for enhanced side-impact protection.\n\n While the Doona+ and Doona i were available, I didn’t find the brand relevant to my needs. Living in the capital, our main modes of transportation within the city are buses, the metro, and occasionally taxis. With my first child, we rarely used a stroller, preferring a baby carrier (slings). These parameters suggested that the Doona+ or Doona i would be perfect for us. However, I couldn’t overlook the fact that the child couldn’t lie flat in the stroller, and the wheel suspension wasn’t the best.",

These features are highly appealing. \nCurrently, my hesitation stems from the lack of ADAC safety certification and the push handle height, which, at 101 cm, is too low for my husband. In comparison, an Orbit Baby or Stokke stroller can have handles adjusted up to 135 cm, which makes a significant difference. \nOverall, Doona’s popularity and market relevance are undeniable and clearly on the rise.",

      "history": "With locations in Hong Kong, Kulmbach, Bayreuth, and Prague, Cybex sells its products internationally, catering to modern urban lifestyles. At the heart of the brand is the CYBEX D.S.F. Innovation Principle, which combines unique Design, unsurpassed Safety, and intelligent Functionality. This approach has led to the development of award-winning products like the rear-facing Sirona car seat, earning Cybex no less than fifteen Red Dot Design Awards.\n\n Cybex is not only recognized for its commitment to safety but also for its innovative designs and fashion-forward approach. By constantly challenging the status quo, Cybex has redefined the industry, offering products that seamlessly blend safety, design, and function. \n\nThe merger with Goodbaby International in 2014 further strengthened Cybex's position, leveraging Goodbaby's extensive research, development, and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nEuropean chic meets German pedantry in Cybex products, catering to modern parents who prioritize both style and safety. With a commitment to quality and safety endorsed by European testing organizations, Cybex continues to set new benchmarks in child safety, starting with its pioneering child car seats in 2000.",

Without the features and performance necessary to function as a jogging stroller, it is hard to find a reason to purchase it. It earned a 4 out of 10 for run-ability, making it a product we think parents will be disappointed if running is their plan. Compared to the competition, which includes strollers with higher scores and better performance coupled with lower list prices, it is a no-brainer to say we do not recommend this stroller.",

        "reviewer-intro": "The Baby Jogger City Select 2 Double is an inline stroller with somewhat stadium-style seating, included in our best double stroller review. This stroller offers multiple seating configurations, including two toddler seats in various directions and two car seats with adapters. The Select 2 has good size storage that is easy to access and brakes that are foot-friendly and easy to set and release. Unfortunately, this stroller is long and harder to maneuver, requiring a thoughtful approach and planning ahead. The fold is ridiculously bulky, and if you want to fit it almost anywhere, you'll have to remove the second seat to do it. The most frustrating is how close the toddler seats are to one another. If you use both, the front seat can't recline without hitting the child behind than, and the child behind them can kick the front seat at will. It seems like a design flaw in our minds, and the best strollers do this style better. Overall, the City Select 2 is an okay stroller, but it didn't meet the performance of the competition in our tests.",

However, even that isn't enough to make it one we think is a good fit for most families. This stroller has remained essentially unchanged for over 10 years. The features and functions feel dated compared to newer designs, and the functionality is somewhat lacking in most tests. The smaller wheels had trouble both on and off-road, and the narrow wheelbase left it somewhat tippy when trying to negotiate tight turns. The storage bin has a bar that goes across, limiting access, and the seatback can't be lifted with one hand. Overall, it is a somewhat dull stroller that can get the job done, but we think there are higher-performing options that parents and passengers will enjoy more.",

Since its inception, BOB has been synonymous with quality, offering parents the ultimate in off-road mobility for their active lifestyles. \n\n The BOB Legacy\nBOB, short for Beast of Burden, was founded in 1994 by two fathers who shared a passion for outdoor adventures with their children. Frustrated by the lack of suitable strollers for rough terrain, they set out to design a solution that could keep up with their active lifestyles. The result was the BOB Sport Utility Stroller, a game-changer in the world of all-terrain strollers.",
      "history": "Built for Adventure\nAt the heart of every BOB stroller lies a commitment to rugged performance. Whether you're tackling rocky trails, sandy beaches, or snowy landscapes, BOB strollers are up to the challenge. With features like adjustable suspension systems, pneumatic tires, and a lightweight yet durable frame, these strollers glide effortlessly over any terrain, providing a smooth ride for both parent and child. \nSafety and Comfort\n\nWhile BOB strollers excel in off-road performance, they never compromise on safety and comfort. Each stroller undergoes rigorous testing to ensure compliance with the highest safety standards. From secure harness systems to padded seats and adjustable canopies, BOB strollers prioritize the well-being of your little one, allowing you to explore with peace of mind.\n\nVersatility at its Core\nOne of the hallmarks of the BOB brand is its versatility. Whether you're a dedicated runner, a weekend hiker, or simply enjoy long walks in the park, there's a BOB stroller to suit your needs. With options ranging from jogging strollers to all-terrain models, parents can find the perfect match for their active lifestyle.\nIn 2011, Britax expanded its portfolio with the acquisition of BOB Gear, a renowned brand of jogging pushchairs and accessories. This strategic move further solidified Britax's position in the childcare industry, offering parents a comprehensive range of products to meet their needs.",

It has a locking swivel front wheel and pneumatic tires that make it comfy for the pusher and the passenger. We like the utilitarian nature of this stroller and think it is a great off-roading option for those who like to adventure off the sidewalk. However, it can do double duty for everyday errands as well, with large storage, nap-able seating, and features that benefit everyone. However, it is big and clunky when folded, and folding is a two-hand deal, while other competitors are one and stand by themselves. It also lacks the sleekness of other joggers and could be more stroller than you need. Overall, it is an option for those who love the outdoors and still need something for everyday life.",

        "reviewer-intro": "The Bugaboo Donkey 5 is a big burly lug of a double stroller. It comes with two bassinets and two toddler seats, making into one of the only options in our review designed with twins in mind. It is adjustable for 1-2 seats and one seat with a storage bin. We think it maneuvers well and has tight turns for such a wide ride, and we enjoyed the large sunshades and deep recline seats. However, this stroller has a bulky fold with no fold lock, and we don't think it will fit in everyone's car without dismantling it. So it might be a no-go if you need to drive to where you plan to use it. Overall, we get why people are drawn to this cool-looking, high-quality stroller, but it struggles to be truly useable for most parents, and we think the size alone can make it a struggle for parents of multiple children. Compared to the top-ranked strollers, it simply failed to perform as well.",

One popular option is the Bugaboo Butterfly. While also marketed as a pushchair for city-dwellers thanks to its one-handed one-second fold, it quickly became a hit for families heading on holiday as it folds down into an ultra-compact package and is IATA-compatible, meaning it can be used as carry-on luggage on planes.",

What began as a venture into automotive safety equipment in 1938 has blossomed into a leading manufacturer of childcare safety products, including car seats and strollers. \n\nA Journey of Innovation\nThe roots of Britax trace back to its inception as a manufacturer of automotive safety accessories in the late 1930s. Over the decades, Britax diversified its portfolio, delving into aircraft interiors, car mirrors, and eventually, childcare safety products. In the 1960s, Britax made significant strides in safety technology, introducing the kite-mark BS 3254 for car seats and pioneering the inertia reel seat belt, a revolutionary innovation that saved lives.

These acquisitions expanded Britax's reach, bringing its innovative products to new markets across Europe and Oceania.\n\n Setting Standards for Safety\nThroughout its history, Britax has been instrumental in setting safety standards for the industry. The introduction of the Isofix (LATCH) system in collaboration with Volkswagen in 1997 revolutionized child seat installation, enhancing safety and ease of use for parents worldwide. Britax's dedication to safety is evident in its patent portfolio, boasting over 180 granted patents in the United States alone.\nA Commitment to Quality\nBritax's reputation for quality and reliability is unmatched. From its early days manufacturing automotive safety equipment to its current lineup of childcare safety products, Britax sets the standard for excellence. Each product undergoes rigorous testing to ensure compliance with the highest safety standards, providing parents with peace of mind.\nThe BOB Gear Acquisition\n\nIn 2011, Britax expanded its portfolio with the acquisition of BOB Gear, a renowned brand of jogging pushchairs and accessories. This strategic move further solidified Britax's position in the childcare industry, offering parents a comprehensive range of products to meet their needs.",

      "intro": "Peg Perego, the Italian company founded in 1949 by Giuseppe Perego, revolutionized the market by designing carriages and strollers using “rubberized fabric” instead of sheet metal and wicker which were commonly in use and providing everyone with child care products that until that time had a limited market due to high costs.Avant-garde, attention to market changes and foresight have built a successful company over time which is known all over the world for its original ideas in the fields of infant care and toys, which are always of the highest quality, respect international safety regulations and are up to speed with the expectations of the modern mom.The campaign “Mamma in Italy” confirms the company’s creed in the Italian way of production which has earned the trust of mother’s for its quality: whoever loves “Made in Italy” looks for style, elegance, details and safety, quality ideas which Peg Perego constantly refers to when designing and creating its products.For Peg Perego, Made in Italy means “to continue doing only what we know how to do well”, says Lucio Perego, the company’s CEO, meaning to continue cultivating the patrimony of skills of Peg’s Italian production and enriching it with modern and avant-garde processing methods.",
      "history": "The company has, in fact, supported its traditional spring season line of juvenile products (strollers, carriages, car seats and high chairs) with toy production, which has allowed using stable and optimal human resources. The integrated production offers closer quality control and an improvement in skills: from materials (fabric, rubber, metal) to the technology of complex and avant-garde production machinery. A team of experts supervises the entire production process to guarantee juvenile products.The compact and traditional organizational structure with a variety of tasks and taking care of the work environment with a great amount of attention given to the people consolidate company loyalty. The production facilities in Italy are: Arcore (Milan), San Donà di Piave (Venice), Ceggia (Venice), and add our international partners: Fort Wayne (USA), Toronto (Canada) Limeira SP (Brazil), for a total production surface area of 161.000 square meters.Peg Perego’s dynamic abilities can also been seen in recent creations: not only the building of a nursery dedicated to the founder, Giuseppe Perego, located in front of the offices and available for new mothers who work for the company, but also the reconstruction of the entire industrial area and the creation of a modern foodservice building for all of the employees.The site http://www.pegperego.com/, updated constantly, provides the trade and customers with all the new products, services and useful information needed when making an important purchase.We can talk about Peg Perego “System”: a way to produce characterized by research and experimentation, productive rigour, technical creativity and also a strong manufacturing culture which answers the client’s needs in terms of services and safety in purchasing child products.Only if the industry is able to translate new ideas into products that are able to “enter and withstand” the test of time, do these ideas take on a role in the usage culture: this is the case of Peg Perego’s Italian history.",
