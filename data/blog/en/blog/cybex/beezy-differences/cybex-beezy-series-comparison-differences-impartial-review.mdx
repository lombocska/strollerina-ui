## Intro

The Cybex Beezy, introduced in 2020, is a compact stroller inspired by the popular GB Qbit+ All-City model. Part of Cybex's Gold line, the Beezy is designed for travel and offers a simpler design compared to its sibling, with streamlined lines, basic upholstery, and a canopy shape similar to the Cybex Eezy strollers.

So far, we can say there are 3 further improved Beezy models. (2022, 2023, 2024)

The Beezy is lightweight, folds easily with one hand, and becomes ultra-compact—small enough to fit in some airline overhead compartments (though it's always best to confirm with the airline). It supports up to 22 kg and features a spacious, lie-flat, world-facing seat. Additionally, it is compatible with car seats and the Cot To Go foldable carrycot, making it suitable from birth and practical for travel until a child no longer needs a stroller.
This article will be detailed, covering all previous models, colors, features, and other useful and interesting information.
