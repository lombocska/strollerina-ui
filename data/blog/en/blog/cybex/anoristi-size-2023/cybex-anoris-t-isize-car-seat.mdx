## Intro

My previous article was about the 2024 ADAC car seat test, where there were big winners and shocking results. You can read the article [here](https://www.strollerina.com/en/blog/en/blog/adac/2024-adac-test-bests-worsts-huge-fails-peg-perego-twist), which focuses on car seats for children aged 0–13 month tested in 2024.

In this article, however, we’re shifting to a different age group and examining the ADAC-winning Cybex Anoris T i-Size car seat designed for children aged 15 months and older. I’ve mentioned before that on my website, www.strollerina.com — which I developed — you can compare car seats very well, for example based on the ADAC verdict. If you filter for Cybex and sort by ADAC rating, you’ll see that the Anoris T i-Size has a rating of 1.5, placing it in the excellent category with ISOFIX attachment.

## ADAC 2022

The Anoris car seat has an excellent ADAC rating of 1.5 with ISOFIX attachment. This seat cannot be secured in any other way, meaning it cannot be installed in a car without ISOFIX mounting points. It is also important to note that the child can only be secured with the impact shield and not with the car’s seat belt.

Although it may be possible to install a CYBEX car seat on other seats in the vehicle, the safest place for a car seat is in the rear seat, behind the front passenger seat.

All essential information and features about the Anoris can be found on www.strollerina.com, such as that this is an impact shield seat, which according to the manufacturer, can be used from 15 months to 6 years of age. The shield also includes an airbag, which Cybex describes as a full-body airbag in a compact depth-adjustable impact shield, keeping your child safe and free to move.

Regarding side impact protection, 25% of road accidents are side crashes. Advanced Linear Side-impact Protection reduces impact forces by up to 20%, transferring them into the car seat’s energy-absorbing shell and headrest. According to i-Size dimensions (ECE R129), the lower limit is 76 cm, while the upper limit is 115 cm. It is evident that the classification based on age is far from the child’s height measurement. Anyone who has seen a 76 cm child sitting in this impact shield seat cannot confidently say that this lower limit is appropriate. It is also noteworthy that this seat cannot be rotated to a rear-facing position, meaning the child will be forward-facing, which is not recommended for children under (min) 2 years old. In fact, the Swedish Plus Test is not even willing to test car seats that can be forward-facing for children under 2 years old.

Since the Plus Test’s introduction and up until 2023 no forward facing seat had passed the Plus Test. Seats that could be used in both directions also had to be tested with both modes and therefore did not pass the extremely tough Plus Test.
In 2023 Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) introduced an updated version of the Test protocol, which amongst other things now allows only rear facing seats to be tested. — [source](https://www.besafe.com/en/safety-tips/tests-awards/the-swedish-plus-test/)

Many parents might think how uncomfortable it is for a child to travel rear-facing, their legs don’t fit, they might get nauseous, etc. The reality is that these are all our thoughts; the child doesn’t find these things problematic. The most likely reason a child cries is because they can’t see out properly in the rear-facing position, or simply because they are annoyed by being strapped in. One of the biggest fatal mistakes we can make during car trips with a small child is to put them in a forward-facing position too early. We need to understand that even if the child cries, it is in their best interest to sit rear-facing.


## Installation

This is the best seat in this group for ease of use, being a doddle to install using the Isofix fittings and stability foot. There’s an electronic indicator on the top of the foot with an image of the seat and lights that turn green when each element has been fitted correctly. The fitting instructions are on Cybex’s website and include a good video (with captions) that is easy to follow.

## Dimensions

The seat itself weighs 12 kg, is 662 mm high with the load leg, 440 mm wide, and 614 mm deep with the base. There are 3 recline positions that allow you to adjust the seat if your child falls asleep.



## Cover

The seat cover is easy to remove and machine washable. This is a big plus because anyone who has seen a car seat cover after a long trip knows that it often requires a thorough cleaning.


## Warranty

Cybex provides a 2-year manufacturer warranty if the product is registered.

In 2024, the Anoris T2 i-Size was released, featuring a built-in suncanopy and differing dimensions. According to the manufacturer, this model can be used up to approximately 7 years old (or 125 cm total height). The color options have also been expanded.
A full-body airbag is housed in a small impact shield, upgraded with a depth-adjustment feature for a snug fit and freedom to move.

## Overall


All things considered, according to the ADAC tests, the Cybex Anoris T i-Size car seat is the safest seat available for toddlers and young children. However, it is worth noting that the Swedish Plus Test does not test forward-facing seats, meaning they do not consider this seat suitable for this age group. They believe that as long as possible, children should sit in a rear-facing position to reduce the forces acting on their necks. The seat itself is designed with a very breathable cover, its safety features are outstanding, and if the child can tolerate the shield, this can be a good choice.
