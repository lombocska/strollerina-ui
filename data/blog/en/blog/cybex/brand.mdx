## History

Cybex is a leading manufacturer of child safety products, including child car seats, strollers, baby carriers, and kids furniture.

Founded in 2005 by Martin Pos in Hong Kong as CYBEX Industrial Ltd., the company has since become synonymous with innovation and quality in the industry. 

In 2014, Cybex was acquired by Goodbaby International, a Chinese child safety manufacturer, further solidifying its position as a global leader in child safety.

With locations in Hong Kong, Kulmbach, Bayreuth, and Prague, Cybex sells its products internationally, catering to modern urban lifestyles. At the heart of the brand is the CYBEX D.S.F. Innovation Principle, which combines unique design, unsurpassed safety, and intelligent functionality. This approach has led to the development of award-winning products like the rear-facing Sirona car seat, earning Cybex no less than fifteen Red Dot Design Awards.
