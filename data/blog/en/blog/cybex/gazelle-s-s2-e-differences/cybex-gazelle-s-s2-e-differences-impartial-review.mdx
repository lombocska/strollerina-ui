## Intro

The Cybex Gazelle series has gained popularity as a modular stroller designed to grow with your family. First introduced with the Gazelle S, this stroller offers impressive versatility, enabling configurations for one or two children, making it perfect for families expanding over time. The Gazelle S2 and e-Gazelle have since been introduced, improving upon the original's features and functionality.

This article provides a detailed comparison of the Gazelle S, Gazelle S2, and the innovative e-Gazelle, covering their differences, standout features, and suitability for various family needs.

** Now let's talk about the weight capacity regarding the double seat setup.  I see a lot of desinformative article about the Gazelle, so let's make it clear, right from the Gazelle manuals.
Cybex made a very clear infographic about what is the max capacity of the different setups.

*Note that they have manuals and assembling videos about Gazelle S1 showing the second seat built-in adapter has a button to swivel, but in the reality, it's not always there. I bought once an S1 in 2023 and I had a swivel button in a Taupe frame, but in different Reddit subs you will find moms, who got strollers without it. It wass probably a touch-up that wasn't communicated clearly. This feature introduced in the S2 in 2023.*

## Conclusion

The Cybex Gazelle series offers a stroller for every family type. Whether you prefer the original Gazelle S, the refined S2, or the high-tech e-Gazelle with motor assistance, there’s a model to fit your needs.

I would say, if the budget is tight, choose the Gazelle S. If practicality is a priority, then go for the S2. If you live in a hilly area, you definitely need the e-Gazelle. I pushed the S2 with two children uphill, and all I can say is that after five minutes, I felt exhausted—literally.

**Which Gazelle is right for you?** If you need cutting-edge technology and ease of use, the e-Gazelle is worth the investment. For those seeking affordability (on the quality stroller market) with versatility, the Gazelle S or S2 remain excellent options.
