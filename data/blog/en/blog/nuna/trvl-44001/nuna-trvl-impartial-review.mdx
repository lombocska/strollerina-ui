When my son turned 3.5 years old, he outgrew our Cybex Gazelle S2 double stroller. 
After that, I still used the Gazelle for longer walks as a single stroller for mz daughter, but for busy weekdays, quick trips in and out of the car, shopping, and other urban errands, we knew we needed a lightweight stroller that was truly compact. 

Using my own stroller search criteria on https://www.strollerina.com/en/strollers, I set the main priorities, and based on those, we chose the Nuna TRVL stroller. 
Luckily, I managed to find one in perfect condition second-hand at a great price. 
After several months of use, I now feel it’s the right time to write an impartial review about it.
