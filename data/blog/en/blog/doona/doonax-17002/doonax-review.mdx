## Intro

When it comes to choosing baby gear, parents often seek products that combine safety, convenience, and style. The Doona Infant Car Seat Stroller has gained significant popularity for its unique features and innovative design. But is it the right choice for you?
Doona X represents the new generation of the Doona Car Seat & Stroller, offering three recline positions: Sit, Relax, and Lay Back. This feature allows your child to lie down and relax comfortably. Like the Doona i, it meets the European i-Size safety regulation (R-129) and includes an adjustable harness and headrest. The Doona X also boasts patented shock absorbers and a smooth-release system for a smoother, safer ride, along with the Doona SIP add-on for enhanced side-impact protection.

While the Doona+ and Doona i were available, I didn’t find the brand relevant to my needs. Living in the capital, our main modes of transportation within the city are buses, the metro, and occasionally taxis. With my first child, we rarely used a stroller, preferring a baby carrier (slings). These parameters suggested that the Doona+ or Doona i would be perfect for us. However, I couldn’t overlook the fact that the child couldn’t lie flat in the stroller, and the wheel suspension wasn’t the best.

## Overall

Two months ago, the Doona X was introduced. If I were expecting my first child now, my perspective would be entirely different. The Doona X can recline in three positions, has an adjustable harness and ISOFIX compatibility, improved suspension, and a smoother transformation process into a stroller. These features are highly appealing.
Currently, my hesitation stems from the lack of ADAC safety certification and the push handle height, which, at 101 cm, is too low for my husband. In comparison, an Orbit Baby or Stokke stroller can have handles adjusted up to 135 cm, which makes a significant difference.
Overall, Doona’s popularity and market relevance are undeniable and clearly on the rise.
