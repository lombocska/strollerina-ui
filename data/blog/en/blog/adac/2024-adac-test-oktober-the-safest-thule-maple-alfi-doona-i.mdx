# ADAC Child Seat Test 2024: Which Models Are the Safest?

Each year, the ADAC rigorously tests child seats to help parents make informed decisions about safety and practicality. 
For 2024 (Fall), 17 new models were evaluated for **safety, ease of operation, ergonomics, and pollutant content**. While many excelled, one seat fell short due to high pollutant levels.

## Highlights of the ADAC 2024 Child Seat Test

- **17 child seats tested across all sizes**: baby, toddler, and older children.
- **12 models rated "good"**, with high marks in safety and usability.
- **1 seat failed** due to unacceptable levels of pollutants in the material.

Choosing a suitable child seat can be overwhelming, but the ADAC results make it easier to find a safe and reliable option for your child.

## Recommendations for Parents

### Rear-Facing Seats for Safety
ADAC recommends keeping children in rear-facing seats for as long as possible, ideally until they turn two. Rear-facing seats reduce head and neck movement during a collision, offering superior protection.

By following these recommendations and using ADAC test results as a guide, parents can confidently select a safe and reliable child seat for their children.
