## Cleaning Your Stroller: Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. **Start with the Fabric**

- **Remove and Wash:** Detach the stroller’s fabric parts, such as the seat cover or canopy, if possible. Machine wash them on a gentle cycle or hand wash as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
- **Spot Cleaning:** For non-removable fabrics, use a mild soap solution and a soft brush to gently scrub away stains.
- **Dry Thoroughly:** Air-dry all fabric components to prevent mold or mildew.
