# Cybex Melio Lightweight Stroller Review, Advantages, Disadvantages & Dimensions

The Cybex Melio Carbon is an ultra-lightweight, stylish stroller designed for city life. 
It’s among the lightest strollers on the market, making it a strong contender for parents seeking convenience, style, and comfort for their child.
The Cybex Melio Carbon glides effortlessly on smooth city streets, providing a seamless one-handed push. 
However, its lightweight frame makes it less stable when navigating pavement edge and steps. 
Despite rear suspension and front shock absorbers, the smaller wheels can struggle with uneven surfaces.

**Comfort and Design**

- The seat is spacious and fully reclinable, making it ideal for naptime.
- The reversible seat unit allows children to face parents or explore the world ahead.
- The adjustable handlebar accommodates different heights for comfortable pushing.
- The XXL sun canopy offers UPF50+ protection and mesh windows for ventilation and visibility.
- The flip-flop-friendly brake ensures easy stopping and safety.

# Mamas&Papas Airo Lightweight Stroller Review, Advantages, Disadvantages & Dimensions

The Mamas & Papas Airo is the latest addition to the brand’s stroller lineup, designed for parents who need a compact, lightweight, and travel-friendly pushchair. 
Straight out of the box, the Airo requires minimal setup. Unfolding it is simple, and it’s ready to go in seconds. 
The rose gold special edition adds a premium feel, complemented by dark fabric that looks stylish and modern. If rose gold isn’t your style, there are other color options, including black, grey, mint, and grapefruit.

The Newborn Carrycot pack (sold separately) transforms the Airo into a suitable ride for newborns. 
Unlike traditional carrycots, this is more of a padded cocoon that secures to the seat. 
It includes a harness for extra safety—a rare feature in carrycots, but one that provides peace of mind, especially when navigating stairs. 
The removable head cushion ensures added comfort for smaller babies.

Equipped with EVA wheels, the Airo handles city pavements and smooth off-road paths with ease. 
The slightly larger rear wheels improve stability, though on rougher terrain like thick grass or mud, it struggles a bit—particularly with a heavier toddler. 
While it’s not built for countryside hikes, it’s well-suited for urban environments and short outdoor strolls.

# Cybex Libelle 2024 Dimensions, Wheels, Features and Seat

Ultra-compact, lightweight, and designed with travel in mind, the Cybex Libelle is an excellent choice for parents who are always on the go.

Right out of the box, everything you need to get started is included—the fully assembled stroller, a rain cover, and an instruction manual. 
While additional accessories like a footmuff, bumper bar, and travel bag are available separately, we didn’t test these extras.

As one of the lightest strollers on the market with an impressively compact fold, the Cybex Libelle is ideal for frequent travelers, those with limited car boot space, or parents who rely on public transport. 
However, some users have noted minor drawbacks. For example, a mom on Reddit mentioned that while the seat’s recline mechanism is easy to adjust, it can slip if a child moves around too much. 
Also worth to mention it does not fully recline and the seat is not reversible.

Additionally, the lack of a bumper bar means little ones don’t have anything to hold on to while riding, you have to probably buy it separately.

# Joolz Aer+ Lightweight Stroller Review, Advantages, Disadvantages & Dimensions


One of my favourite is this masterpiece. This is a 3in1 stroller that can be folded with the carrycot and the seat as well with one hand. Regarding fold mechanism, it is self-standing after you folded it. 
Pretty compact and the material that has used is quite good. 

## Pros

- Effortless one-handed folding and unfolding
- Compact and easy to carry
- Breathable design, perfect for warm weather
- Extra-long seat, ideal for taller children
- Stylish and modern appearance
- Lifetime warranty for peace of mind

## Cons

- Recline mechanism can be tricky to use
- Not suitable for newborns
- Leg rest and bumper bar sold separately

**Comments from Reddit**

- *"You would need their bassinet for newborn phase because the regular seat isn’t ok until 6 months but other than that, it’s not an issue. It has good suspension and a good sized basket."*
- *"Pros: Size and weight, easy to fold, easy to maneuver. Cons: small basket, small wheels."*
- *"I use it as my primary stroller and have had no issues. I use it for the kinds of things you mentioned. I also have the carrycot and used that until my son was about 6 months. I have the car seat adapters + a Nuna Pipa car seat, but funnily enough have never had the need to put the car seat on the stroller. Maybe you will."*

# Cybex Coya Lightweight Stroller Review, Advantages, Disadvantages & Dimensions

The **CYBEX Coÿa** (or simply **Coya**) is a stylish and ultra-compact stroller designed for parents who value both aesthetics and functionality. Perfect for travel or occasional outings like shopping trips, the Coya blends sleek **frame elements from the Priam and Mios** with **premium fabrics, metallic accents, and a sophisticated finish**.  

Its **lightweight and compact build** makes it ideal for maneuvering through busy city streets and effortless air travel. The **seat fully reclines via a simple strap mechanism**, and the **adjustable leg rest** allows for a true **lie-flat position**, ensuring comfort for your child. A built-in **ventilation panel** keeps the seat breathable during warm weather. For newborns, the **Coya transforms into a travel system** by attaching a car seat over the reclined seat.  

Additional thoughtful features include an **integrated carry strap for easy transport**, a **convenient storage pouch on the backrest**, and a **spacious, accessible basket**, making the **Coya a practical yet luxurious choice for on-the-go families**.

## Pro

- Effortless Folding – Collapses easily into a compact size for seamless storage and transport.
- Travel-Friendly – Meets most airline cabin baggage requirements, making it ideal for flying.
- Versatile Compatibility – Can be used as part of a travel system when paired with a car seat.
- Spacious Storage – A large basket and an additional sun hood pocket provide ample room for essentials.
- Adjustable Harness – Simple to adjust without the need for rethreading.
- Universal Handlebar Height – Comfortable to push for caregivers of different heights.

## Cons

- Forward-Facing Only – Doesn’t offer a parent-facing option unless using a compatible car seat.
- Limited Seat Positioning – The highest seat position isn’t fully upright, and reclining can be a bit jerky.
- Not the Best for Rough Terrain – Performs well on smooth surfaces but struggles with uneven ground.
- No Bumper Bar – Unlike some competitors, it lacks a front safety bar.
- Performance & Practicality

While the Coya performs smoothly on city streets and paved paths, it’s less suited for rugged terrain. Grass is manageable, but gravel and uneven surfaces can make the ride feel less stable. The handlebar, wrapped in premium leatherette, doesn’t adjust in height but is ergonomically designed to suit a wide range of users, from 5'6" to 6'4".

What’s in the Box?

- Stroller frame with wheels
- Seat unit
- Shopping basket
- Sun canopy
- Carry strap
- Rain cover

# Bugaboo Butterfly Lightweight Stroller Review, Advantages, Disadvantages & Dimensions


The Bugaboo Butterfly is a compact and lightweight stroller designed for parents who need a space-saving yet practical solution for travel and daily use. 
At just 7.3kg, it is easy to carry and maneuver, **making it a convenient choice for urban environments and public transport**. 
Its quick and effortless folding mechanism allows for seamless transitions between use and storage, whether at home, in the car, or on the go.

One of its standout features is the **large underseat basket** (which is outstanding regarding this lightweight category), which offers an impressive 8kg capacity, providing ample room for shopping bags or baby essentials. 
The adjustable harness ensures a secure and comfortable fit for growing children, while the extendable sun canopy offers added protection on sunny days. 


Many review states this stroller is also IATA approved, however, due to its dimensions, **it is not officially classified as IATA/"cabin approved"** meaning it is suitable for air travel. We can state that it can often be taken into the cabin, but it's not officially. and may not fit in every airline’s overhead compartment.

While the Bugaboo Butterfly is a versatile and durable stroller, it is not suitable for newborns, unlike models such as the Bugaboo Dragonfly. However, it can be made compatible with certain car seats using separate adapters. Additionally, despite its compact design, it handles off-road terrain surprisingly well, making it a reliable choice for both city streets and countryside strolls.

# Inglesina Quid 2 Lightweight Stroller Review, Advantages, Disadvantages & Dimensions


The **Inglesina Quid2** is an ultra-lightweight, **compact** stroller designed for parents who need a **versatile and easy-to-carry** option for everyday use and travel.
Weighing **just under 6kg**, it is one of the **lightest strollers** on the market and folds down small enough to fit in overhead storage compartments on most planes. 
Its **sleek, modern design** and **premium materials** reflect Inglesina’s commitment to style and functionality.  

## Pros  

- One of the Quid2’s standout features is its **one-handed folding mechanism**, making it convenient for parents on the go. **Folding the stroller is seamless**—press the **grey button**, pull it towards you, and it neatly compacts itself. 
- Unfolding is also designed to be one-handed, though it may require an extra shake to fully lock into place. Many parents have praised the folding system as **"intuitive" and "effortless,"** while some note that a firm shake is sometimes necessary to ensure proper unfolding.  
- The **Quid2 glides smoothly** over pavements and handles curbs with ease, making it well-suited for urban environments. Despite its compact design, it **performs well on grass and even light off-road terrain** such as forest paths. The stroller’s lightweight frame allows for **effortless steering**, ensuring a smooth experience when navigating busy streets or tight spaces.  
- The **ergonomically designed handle** provides a **comfortable grip**, though it is not height-adjustable. 

## Cons

- It is well-positioned for users of **average height**, though **taller individuals may find themselves occasionally kicking the brake pedal** due to the stroller’s compact design.

# Conclusion

Overall, all ten strollers stand out among the lightweight options on the market and can be confidently recommended.  

We are also currently in the process of purchasing a stroller for our 2-year-old toddler. Among these models, our top three favorites are the **Bugaboo Butterfly, Cybex Melio 2024, and Joolz Aer+**.  

We will most likely choose the **Melio**, as the **reversible seat** is an important feature for us, along with the **lightweight design**, which we are not willing to compromise on.  

I hope you enjoyed this rather lengthy article and found it useful!
