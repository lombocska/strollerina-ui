By constantly challenging the status quo, Cybex has redefined the industry, offering products that seamlessly blend safety, design, and function. \n\nThe merger with Goodbaby International in 2014 further strengthened Cybex's position, leveraging Goodbaby's extensive research, development, and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nEuropean chic meets German pedantry in Cybex products, catering to modern parents who prioritize both style and safety. With a commitment to quality and safety endorsed by European testing organizations, Cybex continues to set new benchmarks in child safety, starting with its pioneering child car seats in 2000.",

It earned a 4 out of 10 for run-ability, making it a product we think parents will be disappointed if running is their plan. Compared to the competition, which includes strollers with higher scores and better performance coupled with lower list prices, it is a no-brainer to say we do not recommend this stroller.",

This stroller offers multiple seating configurations, including two toddler seats in various directions and two car seats with adapters. The Select 2 has good size storage that is easy to access and brakes that are foot-friendly and easy to set and release. Unfortunately, this stroller is long and harder to maneuver, requiring a thoughtful approach and planning ahead. The fold is ridiculously bulky, and if you want to fit it almost anywhere, you'll have to remove the second seat to do it. The most frustrating is how close the toddler seats are to one another. If you use both, the front seat can't recline without hitting the child behind than, and the child behind them can kick the front seat at will. It seems like a design flaw in our minds, and the best strollers do this style better. Overall, the City Select 2 is an okay stroller, but it didn't meet the performance of the competition in our tests.",

However, even that isn't enough to make it one we think is a good fit for most families. This stroller has remained essentially unchanged for over 10 years. The features and functions feel dated compared to newer designs, and the functionality is somewhat lacking in most tests. The smaller wheels had trouble both on and off-road, and the narrow wheelbase left it somewhat tippy when trying to negotiate tight turns. The storage bin has a bar that goes across, limiting access, and the seatback can't be lifted with one hand. Overall, it is a somewhat dull stroller that can get the job done, but we think there are higher-performing options that parents and passengers will enjoy more.",

Frustrated by the lack of suitable strollers for rough terrain, they set out to design a solution that could keep up with their active lifestyles. The result was the BOB Sport Utility Stroller, a game-changer in the world of all-terrain strollers.",

With features like adjustable suspension systems, pneumatic tires, and a lightweight yet durable frame, these strollers glide effortlessly over any terrain, providing a smooth ride for both parent and child. \nSafety and Comfort\n\nWhile BOB strollers excel in off-road performance, they never compromise on safety and comfort. Each stroller undergoes rigorous testing to ensure compliance with the highest safety standards. From secure harness systems to padded seats and adjustable canopies, BOB strollers prioritize the well-being of your little one, allowing you to explore with peace of mind.\n\nVersatility at its Core\nOne of the hallmarks of the BOB brand is its versatility. Whether you're a dedicated runner, a weekend hiker, or simply enjoy long walks in the park, there's a BOB stroller to suit your needs. With options ranging from jogging strollers to all-terrain models, parents can find the perfect match for their active lifestyle.\nIn 2011, Britax expanded its portfolio with the acquisition of BOB Gear, a renowned brand of jogging pushchairs and accessories. This strategic move further solidified Britax's position in the childcare industry, offering parents a comprehensive range of products to meet their needs.",

However, it can do double duty for everyday errands as well, with large storage, nap-able seating, and features that benefit everyone. However, it is big and clunky when folded, and folding is a two-hand deal, while other competitors are one and stand by themselves.

        "reviewer-intro": "The Bugaboo Donkey 5 is a big burly lug of a double stroller. It comes with two bassinets and two toddler seats, making into one of the only options in our review designed with twins in mind. It is adjustable for 1-2 seats and one seat with a storage bin. We think it maneuvers well and has tight turns for such a wide ride, and we enjoyed the large sunshades and deep recline seats. However, this stroller has a bulky fold with no fold lock, and we don't think it will fit in everyone's car without dismantling it. So it might be a no-go if you need to drive to where you plan to use it. Overall, we get why people are drawn to this cool-looking, high-quality stroller, but it struggles to be truly useable for most parents, and we think the size alone can make it a struggle for parents of multiple children. Compared to the top-ranked strollers, it simply failed to perform as well.",

Over the decades, Britax diversified its portfolio, delving into aircraft interiors, car mirrors, and eventually, childcare safety products.

      "intro": "Peg Perego, the Italian company founded in 1949 by Giuseppe Perego, revolutionized the market by designing carriages and strollers using “rubberized fabric” instead of sheet metal and wicker which were commonly in use and providing everyone with child care products that until that time had a limited market due to high costs.Avant-garde, attention to market changes and foresight have built a successful company over time which is known all over the world for its original ideas in the fields of infant care and toys, which are always of the highest quality, respect international safety regulations and are up to speed with the expectations of the modern mom.The campaign “Mamma in Italy” confirms the company’s creed in the Italian way of production which has earned the trust of mother’s for its quality: whoever loves “Made in Italy” looks for style, elegance, details and safety, quality ideas which Peg Perego constantly refers to when designing and creating its products.For Peg Perego, Made in Italy means “to continue doing only what we know how to do well”, says Lucio Perego, the company’s CEO, meaning to continue cultivating the patrimony of skills of Peg’s Italian production and enriching it with modern and avant-garde processing methods.",
      "history": "The company has, in fact, supported its traditional spring season line of juvenile products (strollers, carriages, car seats and high chairs) with toy production, which has allowed using stable and optimal human resources. The integrated production offers closer quality control and an improvement in skills: from materials (fabric, rubber, metal) to the technology of complex and avant-garde production machinery. A team of experts supervises the entire production process to guarantee juvenile products.The compact and traditional organizational structure with a variety of tasks and taking care of the work environment with a great amount of attention given to the people consolidate company loyalty. The production facilities in Italy are: Arcore (Milan), San Donà di Piave (Venice), Ceggia (Venice), and add our international partners: Fort Wayne (USA), Toronto (Canada) Limeira SP (Brazil), for a total production surface area of 161.000 square meters.Peg Perego’s dynamic abilities can also been seen in recent creations: not only the building of a nursery dedicated to the founder, Giuseppe Perego, located in front of the offices and available for new mothers who work for the company, but also the reconstruction of the entire industrial area and the creation of a modern foodservice building for all of the employees.The site http://www.pegperego.com/, updated constantly, provides the trade and customers with all the new products, services and useful information needed when making an important purchase.We can talk about Peg Perego “System”: a way to produce characterized by research and experimentation, productive rigour, technical creativity and also a strong manufacturing culture which answers the client’s needs in terms of services and safety in purchasing child products.Only if the industry is able to translate new ideas into products that are able to “enter and withstand” the test of time, do these ideas take on a role in the usage culture: this is the case of Peg Perego’s Italian history.",
